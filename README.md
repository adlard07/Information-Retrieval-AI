# ChatGPT Clone

## Overview
This ChatGPT Clone project is a conversational AI system built by fine-tuning the "microsoft/phi-1_5" language model on a new dataset. The model is trained to understand and generate human-like text responses in a conversational manner. This project aims to provide a customizable and deployable chatbot solution for various applications.

## Model Information
The underlying model for this project is based on the "microsoft/phi-1_5" language model. Fine-tuning has been applied to adapt the model to a specific domain or use case, enhancing its performance in generating contextually relevant responses.

## Usage

### 1. Model Deployment
Deploy the fine-tuned model to your preferred platform or server.

### 2. Interaction
Interact with the chatbot by sending messages or queries to the deployed model. The chatbot will respond with contextually appropriate text based on the fine-tuned model.

## Fine-Tuning Data
The model was fine-tuned on a new dataset containing conversational data specific to the desired application or domain. Due to confidentiality or specific use case requirements, the fine-tuning dataset may not be publicly disclosed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Hugging Face Transformers Library
- Flask (for deploying the model as a web service)

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

### `chatbot.py`
Contains the code for interacting with the fine-tuned model and generating responses.

### `data/`
The directory where the fine-tuning dataset is stored (not included in this repository).

### `deployment/`
Includes files and configurations for deploying the model as a web service.

### `utils.py`
Utility functions used for data preprocessing and model interaction.

## Deployment
 Node.js
 React
 Flask (for serving the fine-tuned model)

### 1. Set Environment Variables
Set environment variables for model configuration and deployment settings.

### 2. Run the Flask App
```bash
cd deployment
python app.py
```

The chatbot will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## Future Improvements
- Continuous fine-tuning on additional data for improved performance.
- Integration with external services for enhanced functionality.
- Support for multiple deployment options (e.g., Docker, cloud platforms).
