# Information Retrieval AI / Question Answering AI

## Overview
This project implements an Information Retrieval AI system for question answering, utilizing a pre-trained language model. The chosen model is fine-tuned on a specific dataset to create a powerful and context-aware question answering system. The model is designed to understand and respond to user queries based on a given context, making it suitable for applications such as document analysis and content retrieval.

## Model Used
The project employs the pre-trained model: [Specify Pre-trained Model, e.g., "bert-base-uncased"](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased).

## Fine-Tuning
The fine-tuning process involves training the pre-trained model on a custom dataset containing context-question-answer triplets. The objective is to adapt the model to generate accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries.

## Usage

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (install using `pip install requirement.txt`)

### Steps
1. **Fine-Tune the Model**
   - Refer to the fine-tuning script in the `fine_tuning/` directory.
   - Fine-tune the chosen pre-trained model on your custom question answering dataset.

2. **Set Up the Question Answering System**
   - Utilize the trained model to build a question answering system.
   - The system takes a context and a user question as input and outputs the model-generated answer.

3. **Integration**
   - Integrate the question answering system into your application or interface.

## Project Structure

### `fine_tuning/`
Contains scripts and code for fine-tuning the pre-trained model on a custom question answering dataset.

### `question_answering/`
Houses the code for the question answering system, including input processing and answer generation.

### `utils/`
Utility scripts and functions used across the project.

## Configuration
Adjust the configuration parameters in the respective `config` files to customize the behavior of the fine-tuned model and the question answering system.

## Future Improvements
- Explore ensemble methods for combining multiple pre-trained models for improved accuracy.
- Implement feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement through user interactions.
- Enhance the system's scalability for handling larger datasets and multiple users simultaneously.
